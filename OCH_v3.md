# **Zeebu Smart Contract-Based Clearing House Deployment Documentation**

---

## **Introduction**

The **Zeebu ecosystem** supports deploying smart contract-based clearing houses through **manual deployment by operators** or **automated deployment via Zeebu.fi**. These approaches cater to different levels of technical expertise, ensuring secure, transparent, and decentralized payment processing.

Nodes in the Zeebu ecosystem process transactions and settle invoices up to **$200,000** per transaction, enabling participants to actively contribute to a decentralized and transparent financial network.

---

## **What Does It Mean to "Deploy a Node"?**

Deploying a node involves deploying a **smart contract** on the blockchain that functions as an **On-Chain Clearing House (OCH)** for processing transactions. These smart contracts interact directly with the blockchain, allowing participants to validate and settle invoices while earning rewards.

---

## **Who Should Deploy a Node?**

**Anyone!**

Anyone meeting the selection criteria can deploy a node, contribute to the decentralized payment ecosystem, and earn rewards.

---

## **Why Deploy a Node?**

1. **Earn Passive Rewards**
    - **APY on Staked ZBU Tokens:** Generate passive income through staking.
    - **Invoice Transaction Rewards:** Earn **0.6% of the settled invoice amount** processed through the deployed node.
2. **Participate in the Zeebu Ecosystem**
    - **Decentralization:** Nodes operate on the blockchain, removing intermediaries and enabling secure operations.
    - **Transparency:** Every transaction is traceable and verifiable on the blockchain explorer.
3. **Ensure Transaction Settlement**
    - **On-Chain Clearing House (OCH):** Nodes automatically process invoices and execute tokenomics rules.

---

## **Participation Benefits**

1. **Decentralization:**
    - Contribute to decentralized payment processing and ensure secure, transparent transactions.
2. **Transparency:**
    - All transactions are on-chain and verifiable via blockchain explorers.
3. **Real-Time Rewards:**
    - Receive immediate rewards upon successful invoice transactions.

# **Deployment Approaches**

---

## **1. Manual Deployment by Operators**

**Description:**

Operators manually deploy the clearing house contract using their tools and infrastructure, offering maximum customization and control.

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-Signature Contracts:** Secure transaction approvals.
- **Operator Control:** Full responsibility for gas fees and dependencies.
- **Customization:** Advanced configurations and system integration.

---

## **Pre-requisites for Manual Deployment:**

1. **Wallet Configuration:**
    - Use a multi-signature wallet like **Gnosis Safe** or **Fireblocks.**
    - Add all required signatories with private key access.
2. **Gas Fees Management:**
    - Ensure sufficient native tokens (ETH, BNB) for gas fees.
    - Use tools like **Etherscan Gas Tracker** or **Blocknative.**
3. **Smart Contract Dependencies:**
    - Obtain the clearing house smart contract code from **Zeebu's repository.**
    - Use compatible tools like **Hardhat, Truffle,** or **Remix** for development.
4. **Development Environment:**
    - Install **Node.js** (v16+) and required libraries.
    - Connect to a blockchain node provider like **Infura** or **Alchemy.**
5. **Testing Framework:**
    - Use testnets (e.g., **Goerli, Sepolia**) for contract testing.
    - Set up tools like **Mocha** or **Chai.**

---

## **Manual Deployment Process:**

1. **Write a Deployment Script (deploy.js):**
    
    ```jsx
    javascript
    Copy code
    const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
    
    async function main() {
      const ClearingHouse = await ethers.getContractFactory("ClearingHouse");
      const clearingHouse = await ClearingHouse.deploy();
      console.log("ClearingHouse deployed to:", clearingHouse.address);
    }
    
    main().catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exitCode = 1;
    });
    
    ```
    
2. **Deploy the Contract:**
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
    
    ```
    
3. **Verify Deployment:**
    - Use **Zeebu Explorer** or **Etherscan** to confirm deployment.
